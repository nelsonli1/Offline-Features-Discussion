#### Policy Considerations

- What should be the block list management process to prevent payments from lost / stolen devices?
- What should be the transaction limits for offline transactions?
- How do we define the settlement process?
- How many devices can be issued at the same time?
- What is the process for issuing new digital wallets? What kind of documentation is required from both merchants and consumers?
- To what extent should the transactions be tracked?
- How many devices can an individual have at once?
- How long before we blacklist a card? Should we return the money after blacklisting a card?
- Insurance policy for returning money in case of a natural disaster, fire, etc?
- What policy should be required to prevent double spending?
